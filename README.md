## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS extension language
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Development environment


### What I learned

- Set the default theme according to user preference, retrieved from the `prefers-color-scheme` in users' browsers.
- Utilize Sass mixins and color variables to switch the theme color.
- Grasp the logic of making calculations with JavaScript and React.
- Multiply each number by 100 and divide the result by 100 to avoid extra decimal digits resulting from binary calculations.
